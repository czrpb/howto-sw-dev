# HowTo do Software Development

Herein is my method.

## In The Beginning

SW development basically followed this path:

* Math (Transform)
* Science (Decomposition)
* Modeling

### Math

The initial application of mechanical computational devices basically was a calculator.

### Science

Eventually computers were applied to more than "just math" problems: Applications. The _scientific method_ meant decomposing problems into smaller sub-problems. This lead to structured and modular programming.

### Modeling

Certainly early computer pioneers, such as Kristen Nygaard, applied modeling and simulation resulting in languages such as Simula and Smalltalk, leading to OO.



## Analytic

The main analytic methods I use are:

* Critical Realism
* General Systems Theory

### Critical Realism

CR has both naturalist and metaphysical philosophy.


### General Systems Theory



## Methodology

Because we are basically modeling, we all sit in a room and argue over the "things" in our problem. These are our boundaries. Then, these become our objects/classes.

All of that is fine, except we should look for existing systems/boundaries in the real-world on which we will build our SW as a metaphor.

### Metaphoric Software Development
