# HowTo do Software Development

Herein is my method.

## In The Beginning

SW development basically followed this path:

* Math (Transform)
* Science (Decomposition)
* Modeling (OO)


## Analytic

The main analytic methods I use are:

* Critical Realism
* General Systems Theory


## Methodology

Because we are basically modeling, we all sit in a room and argue over the "things" in our problem. These are our boundaries. Then, these become our objects/classes.

All of that is fine, except we should look for existing systems/boundaries in the real-world on which we will build our SW as a metaphor.
